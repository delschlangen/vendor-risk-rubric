## Key Takeaways

This example demonstrates how **physical safety risks can drive enhanced review requirements** even when there's no data or IT risk. Construction and facilities vendors often score moderate overall but trigger EHS escalation. Key focus areas:

- Insurance adequacy is critical
- Subcontractor management matters
- Coordination with occupied spaces
- Background checks for building access

# Executive Summary: Vendor Risk Assessment Framework

*A one-page overview for leadership*

---

## The Problem

Your organization relies on dozens (or hundreds) of third-party vendors. Each one introduces risk:

| Risk Area | Potential Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Data breaches** | Regulatory fines, customer lawsuits, reputation damage |
| **Worker misclassification** | Back taxes, benefits liability, DOL penalties |
| **Safety incidents** | OSHA citations, workers' comp claims, lawsuits |
| **Vendor failure** | Business disruption, lost revenue, scrambled transitions |
| **AI/ML issues** | Biased decisions, IP disputes, regulatory scrutiny |

Without a structured process, vendor risk management is inconsistent, slow, and reactive.

---

## The Solution

This framework provides a **standardized, scored approach** to vendor risk:

1. **Six-dimension scoring rubric** — Evaluate co-employment, data, safety, access, continuity, and AI/ML risk
2. **Risk-tiered review process** — Route vendors to appropriate review tracks (Standard → Enhanced → High → Critical)
3. **Contract clause library** — Match required protections to risk level
4. **Clear accountability** — RACI matrix defines who does what

---

## Key Benefits

### 1. Reduced Risk Exposure
- Ensure appropriate protections for high-risk vendors
- Catch issues before contracts are signed
- Address AI/ML risks that most frameworks ignore

### 2. Faster Vendor Onboarding
- Low-risk vendors move through quickly (1–2 weeks)
- Clear requirements upfront — no back-and-forth
- Predictable timelines for each tier

### 3. Regulatory Alignment
- Aligns with NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, NIST AI RMF
- Defensible, documented decisions
- Audit-ready process

### 4. Cost Avoidance
- Prevent vendor-related incidents before they occur
- Negotiate appropriate contract terms proactively
- Avoid emergency transitions from failed vendors

## How It Works

```
Vendor Request → Intake Questionnaire → Risk Scoring → Tier Assignment → Required Reviews → Contract Clauses → Approval → Ongoing Monitoring
```

| Score | Tier | Review Level | Timeline |
|-------|------|--------------|----------|
| 0–5 | Standard | Procurement only | 1–2 weeks |
| 6–10 | Enhanced | + Security + Legal | 3–6 weeks |
| 11–15 | High | + Exec sponsor + Full assessment | 6–12 weeks |
| 16–18 | Critical | + C-suite + Board notification | 6–12 weeks |

---

## What's Different About This Framework

| Traditional Approach | This Framework |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Binary (high risk / low risk) | Six dimensions, nuanced scoring |
| Security-focused | Holistic (employment, safety, data, access, continuity, AI) |
| Ignores AI/ML risks | AI/ML is a core dimension |
| Ad-hoc contract terms | Tiered clause library matched to risk |
| Unclear accountability | RACI matrix with named owners |

---

## Implementation Path

| Phase | Duration | Key Activities |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | 2 weeks | Customize rubric, adapt clauses, assign owners |
| **Pilot** | 4 weeks | Test on 5–10 vendors, gather feedback |
| **Rollout** | 4 weeks | Train teams, integrate with procurement, go live |
| **Operate** | Ongoing | Run process, track metrics, improve |

**Minimum investment:** 1 FTE (part-time) for Risk/Compliance lead, plus time from Legal, Security, and Procurement as needed.

---

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Assessment turnaround time | 2 days (Standard), 5 days (Enhanced) |
| Tier distribution | ~60% Standard, ~30% Enhanced, ~10% High+ |
| Contract clause adoption | 100% of contracts include required clauses |
| Exception rate | < 5% |

---

## Risk of Inaction

Without a structured vendor risk framework:

- **Regulatory risk** — Regulators increasingly expect vendor oversight programs
- **Incident risk** — ~60% of data breaches involve third parties
- **Employment risk** — Worker misclassification claims are increasing
- **AI risk** — AI vendor issues are emerging as a major liability area
- **Reputation risk** — Vendor failures become your failures

---

## Recommendation

Adopt this framework to establish a defensible, efficient, and comprehensive vendor risk management process. Start with a 4-week pilot, then roll out organization-wide.

**Next step:** Review the full framework with Legal, Security, and Procurement leads.
